# Python Projects

This repository has/will have many projects/tools developed in Python 2 or 3. Python 2 is used due to macOS's natural support for the language. 

Files:
- `freebook.py`: Gets all the free ebooks from O'Reilly Media.
- `hangman.py`: Hangman---in the Terminal/shell!
- `cointoss.py`: Randomly choose heads/tails
- `scorekeeper.py`: In the name....

There will be `requirements.txt` files for <b>all</b> projects.
To use the `requirements.txt` file, type (in the Terminal, after in the directory of your Python project), 
- Python 2: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Python 3: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
